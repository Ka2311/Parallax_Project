# Parallax_Project
I created a webpage related to adventure using the parallax effect in this project.
- To write the skeleton of the webpage I used HTML.
- To generate the parallax effect I used 3 dimensional properties of CSS.
- To make it stable in the viewport I used CSS properties(size, overflow, hide, etc.).
